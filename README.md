Wine Shoppe with cart

Instructions: 
Design a layout for a page that shows a list of products as the majority of the page and a shopping cart panel as a secondary element. I'd suggest at least a two-column layout (one for each of these goals). Each product in the list should have a buy button, and when you click the buy button the product should show up in the cart.
